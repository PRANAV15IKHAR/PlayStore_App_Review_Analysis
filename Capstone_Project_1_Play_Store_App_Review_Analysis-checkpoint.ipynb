    "Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets for patterns, and anomalies (outliers), and form hypotheses based on our understanding of the dataset and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It is an important step in any Data Analysis or Data Science project. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need.\n",

    "The following are the various steps involved in the EDA process:\n",
    "1. <b>Problem Statement</b> - We shall brainstorm and understand the given data set. We shall study the attributes present in it and try to do a philosophical analysis about their meaning and importance for this problem.\n",
    "2. <b>Hypothesis</b> - Upon studying the attributes present in the data base, we shall develop some basic hypothesis on which we can work and play with the data to look for the varied results which we can get out of it.\n",
    "3. <b>Univariate Analysis</b> - It is the simplest form of analyzing the data. In this we would initially pick up a single attribute and study it in and out. It doesn't deal with any sort of co-relation and it's major purpose is to describe. It takes data, summarizes that data and finds patterns in the data.\n",
    "4. <b>Bivariate Analysis</b> - This analysis is related to cause and the relationship between the two attributes. We will try to understand the dependency of attributes on each other.\n",
    "5. <b>Multivariate Analysis</b> - This is done when more than two variables have to be analyzed simultaneously.\n",
    "5. <b>Data Cleaning</b> - We shall clean the dataset and handle the missing data, outliers and categorical variables.\n",
    "6. <b>Testing Hypothesis</b> - We shall check if our data meets the assumptions required by most of the multivariate techniques."
